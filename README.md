# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Live Demo
https://clone-b2cca.web.app/

### Note
This free API from google has a throttle limit of '100' api calls per day. If you exceed this call limit the api would not return valid data. For local testing, if you there is mock data included in this repo that you can use for any testing purposes instead of hitting the actual google search endpoints

## Google APIs
Get the google custom search key api key from - https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction#identify_your_application_to_google_with_api_key

https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new - You need to toggle this to search the entire web in custom search (enter the url as www.google.com)

You also need to grab the 'search engine id' from the dev api account. This will be used in your code to tell google which search engine to use.

### Endpoint used for google search
```
https://www.googlepis.com/customsearch/v1/?key=${API_KEY}&cx=${CONTEXT_KEY}&q=${term}
```

### Firebase scripts

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Login to firebase
```
firebase login
````

Initialize firebase in your repository
```
firebase init
```

Deploy firebase from your google account
```
firebase deploy
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
